            <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>Melt butter over medium heat in the now empty stockpot. Stir in flour to make a roux by cooking, whisking constantly, until mixture turns medium brown. </li>
            <li>Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest</li>
            <li>Season with sugar and salt to taste</li>
